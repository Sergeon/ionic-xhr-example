# ionic-xhr-example
A tiny mobile app code sample with xhr request and dinamic pages, showing blockchain blocks data from toshi.io build upon ionic framework

##about

This small app just fetch the last 10 bitcoin blocks from toshi.io and display the data.

Lots of front-end developers used to jQuery only know how to do ajax calls with the $.ajax({}) method, so maybe the examples here using the xhr object from angular are useful for someone.

Also there's an example on how to build dinamic pages with ionic: the detail page shows data from an asynchronous call to toshi.io, displaying current selected block data, so the same page can display different contents depending on using interaction.
